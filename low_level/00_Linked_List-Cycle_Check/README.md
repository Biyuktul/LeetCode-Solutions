Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.
Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

## TestCases:
	Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
	Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
	Input: head = [1], pos = -1

## follow up:
	- Can you solve it using O(1) (i.e. constant) memory?
